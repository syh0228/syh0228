## üöÄ Highlighted Data Analytics Projects

### üí≥ Predict Credit Card Approval - [Go to Project](https://github.com/syh0228/syh0228.github.io/blob/3ce57c232d3e54d03ded3ea9204efa3db83ef2c0/PredictCreditCardApproval.pdf)
This project focuses on the credit card application process and aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor, improving operation efficiency. In this project, I selected four algorithms **Support Vector Machine**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** to explore the pattern of data and predict the approval. The outcome is expected to maximise the possibility of successful approval and mitigate the risk of credit card default.

### üç™ Mobile Game A/B Testing with Cookie Cats - [Go to Project](https://github.com/syh0228/syh0228.github.io/blob/391264ebea63cb590dd38de0399bdec470c1ad14/Mobile%20Game%20AB%20Testing%20with%20Cookie%20Cats.ipynb)
The project intends to improve player retention by conducting A/B testing in game design. The experiment seeks to answer the question: should the breaking gate be placed at level 30 or level 40? With the player data of retention in one day and seven days, the Bootstrapping distribution and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) are applied to examine the results.
