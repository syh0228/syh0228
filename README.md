### üí≥ Predict Credit Card Approval - [Go to Project](https://github.com/syh0228/syh0228.github.io/blob/3ce57c232d3e54d03ded3ea9204efa3db83ef2c0/PredictCreditCardApproval.pdf)
This project focuses on the credit card application process and aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor, improving operation efficiency. In this project, I selected four algorithms *Support Vector Machine*, *Decision Tree*, *Random Forest*, and *Logistic Regression* to explore the pattern of data and predict the approval. The outcome is expected to maximise the possibility of successful approval and mitigate the risk of credit card default.

(3) What is the effect of sale price upon the number of sales, and is this different across genres?
