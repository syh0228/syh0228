## ðŸš€ Highlighted Data Analytics Projects

### ðŸ’³ Predict Credit Card Approval - [Go to Project](https://github.com/syh0228/syh0228.github.io/blob/3ce57c232d3e54d03ded3ea9204efa3db83ef2c0/PredictCreditCardApproval.pdf)
This project focuses on the credit card application process and aims to build an automatic credit card approval predictor, improving operation efficiency. In this project, I selected four algorithms `Support Vector Machine`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, and `Logistic Regression` to explore the pattern of data and predict the approval. The outcome is expected to maximise the possibility of successful approval and mitigate the risk of credit card default.
